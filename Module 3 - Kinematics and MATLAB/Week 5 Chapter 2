Our focus will now be on implementing kinematics into a simulations of robotic arms. We shall use MATLAB, along with a Peter Corke's Robotics systems toolbox for this. The following links are each a series of excellent lessons by Corke himself that will guide you do so; one can easily go through them in 2-3 days. Refer to the attachment for toolbox installation instructions.

Note: Corke's Robotics systems toolbox can be found here - https://petercorke.com/toolboxes/robotics-toolbox

This is a different one from MATLAB's own toolbox of the same name (seen here - https://www.mathworks.com/products/robotics.html)
