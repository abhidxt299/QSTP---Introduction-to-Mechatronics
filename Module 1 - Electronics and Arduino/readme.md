# Module 1 - Electronics and Arduino

If you are interested in learning how to program Arduino and create electronic circuits, you've come to the right place. This section covers the very fundamentals of practical electronics prototyping, and will serve as a primer for those interested in designing electronic hardware for robots and other embedded systems. 

The lessons are adapted from the QSTP Mechatronics course, taken by Abhishek Dixit and Tanmay Bhonsale. You don't need any hardware to get started, as all concepts and examples included here can be simulated on [TinkerCAD](http://tinkercad.com). Note that the lessons involve active participation; you will need to try out each example to fully grasp the material. 

## Lesson Descriptions

1. **Lesson01:** Gives a basic introduction to electronics, including how to use a breadboard and basic components like transistors and ICs. 
2. **Lesson02:** Gives a basic introduction to Arduino and how to program it (both in TinkerCAD simulations and in real hardware). 
3. **Lesson03:** Covers Arduino functionality like Serial communication and using LCD displays.
4. **Lesson04**: Covers the basics of controlling motors using Arduino, including servo and stepper motors.
5. **Lesson05:** Covers advanced topics like I2C communication and Interrupts.
