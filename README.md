# QSTP Introduction To Mechatronics

This repository contains all reading materials from the mechatronics summer course taught by [Abhishek Dixit](https://github.com/abhidxt299) and [Tanmay Bhonsale](https://github.com/enceladus2000), as part of the QSTP initiative. The aim of this material is to give a gentle beginner's introduction to electronics, Arduino, CAD modelling, MATLAB and robot kinematics. No hardware is required for the completion of the course, even the Arduino part is done on TinkerCAD, a free online circuit simulator.

*PS: If you are a beginner interested in learning electronics and Arduino program, Module 1 of this course is a great place to get started.*

## Course Structure

This originally 6-week course is split up into 3 independent modules:

1. **Electronics and Arduino:** Covers the basics of electronics and Arduino, from using a breadboard to controlling LCD displays.
2. **CAD Modelling:** Covers basic 3D designing using Fusion360.
3. **Kinematics and MATLAB:** Introduces the concept of robot kinematics and its implementation using MATLAB and its Robotics Systems Toolbox.

## Software Requirements

1. [TinkerCAD](https://www.tinkercad.com/)​ is an online, free for all circuit simulator.
2. [MATLAB and Simulink](https://in.mathworks.com/downloads/)​ (Mathworks products) have free students’ licenses for afew universities. If you are unable to download large files, you may use theonline version of MATLAB, and Xcos instead of Simulink.
3. If your university/college does not have a free student’s license available forMathworks products, you can use alternative softwares like [​Scilab and Xcos](https://www.scilab.org/download/6.0.2)​.
4. [Autodesk Fusion 360](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/students-teachers-educators)​ also has free student’s access here

### What is QSTP?

Quark Summer Technical Projects (QSTP) is a platform where experienced BITS students (currently in their 2/3/4th year); part of the clubs or independently; mentor Project-centric Courses for other students over the summer. This course was held from 11th May to 20th June.

Quark Summer Technical Projects (QSTP) in association with GDG (Google Developers Group) & WTM (Women Techmakers) New Delhi is open for participation from all students irrespective of their branch and year of study.
