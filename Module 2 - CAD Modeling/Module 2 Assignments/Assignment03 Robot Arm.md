Okay, here is the third assignment. Your aim is to build a robotic arm in Fusion 360.

You may use the following links for reference.
1. For a tutorial on designing a robotic arm: https://academy.autodesk.com/course/129015/fusion-360-design-and-customize-vex-edr-clawbot?login=1
2. There are 5 videos in this playlist. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TuTi5xCtz0

Here are the following things to consider while doing the assignment.

1. Design and assemble a 6-Axis industrial robot.
2. You may use your choice of plane for making the base of the robot.
3. The arm should include a claw.
4. Insert the claw arm gear components into the design. Use joints to assemble the claw arm gears. Use joints to complete the assembly of the claw arm.
5. The arm will be mounted on a single motor that will rotate around the vertical axis. The other two motors will respectively lower the arm and tilt the forearm.
6. The arm should have the motor holder on the side (standard nema 17).

Submission format would be a snapshot of the design from 3 different perspectives.
